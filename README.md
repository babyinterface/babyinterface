## about me
hello outer world! it is a huge pleasure to meet you and be here. i am babyinterface and i am here because i like to learn.

honestly, i am still in the learning phase. the main language i code in is java. recently i have been reading about coding web services and clients. i got github because i want to put the things i learn into practice. learning about github has been very fun so far.

theres no real way to reach me, not yet anyway.
